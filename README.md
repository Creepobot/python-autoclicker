# Python Autoclicker
My first and hopefully last python experience
## Usage
It's very simple!
- Run `write.py` if you want to record inputs to `code.txt`. Recording can be stopped by pressing Esc.
- Run `simulate.py` if you want to read and simulate inputs from `code.txt`. Simulation starts 5 seconds after the start of the script.
